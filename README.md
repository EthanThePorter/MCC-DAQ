# Introduction
This software was designed to read data from a Measurement Computing Company (MCC) board, as well as use it to control a number of pumps. Analog input channels on the board are used to read thermocouples and conductivity probes. Analog output channels (VDAC) are used to control the pumps.

The core software behind this application was designed to be reusable. For more information [Click Here](#Code-Summary).

# Usage

## Startup
The software can be run using either a Python interpreter running the `controller.pyw` file, by running the `.bat` file in the project directory, or by creating a shortcut to the `.bat` and opening that.

## Changing Pump Flowrates
Pump flowrates can be changed by going to **Pump Control > Pump Flowrates**. 

## Recording Data
To record data, go to **Record Data > Start Data Recording**. This will begin saving the data from all thermocouples, conductivity probes, and pumps. To end data recording, go to **Record Data > Stop Data Recording**. This will end data acquisition and create a `.xlsx` data file in the desired directory.

## Viewing Data & Changing Output Settings
The directory the data file is saved to can be open by going to **File > Open Data Path**.

To change the filename or directory to save the data to, go to **File > Configure Data Path**. 

# Configuring Channels
## Reading Thermocouples 
The Application is currently configured to read a number of channels designated as thermocouples. The list that defines what channels are read is called `self.thermocouple_channels` and is found in the `App` class in the `__init__()` method. The integers in this list correspond to what channels will be read, plotted, and saved.

## Reading Conductivity Probes
The Application is also currently configured to read a number of channels as the output of a conductivity probe. The list that defines what channels are read is called `self.conductivity_channels` and is found in the `App` class in the `__init__()` method. The integers in this list correspond to what channels will be read, plotted, and saved.

## Controlling Pumps
Pumps can be controlled by adding their VDAC channel to the `self.pump_VDAC_channels` list found in the `App` class in the `__init__()` method. Any integers in this list will automatically have a dialog created to control them in the **Pump Control** menu. 

For every VDAC channel added to this list, a set of calibration values must be added to convert the desired flowrate to a voltage. These calibration values were collected by plotting the voltage (V) inputted into the pump against the measured flow rate(mL/min). A linear equation can be obtained from this plot to act as a calibration curve. For more information on the calibration curve [Click Here](https://github.com/EthanThePorter/MCC-DAQ/blob/master/calibrations/Pump%20Calibration.xlsx). 

For example, if you wanted to control a pump connected to **VDAC Channel 2** with a calibration curve slope of **0.049** and a y-intercept of **2.41**:

```python
self.pump_VDAC_channels = [2]
self.pump_calibration = {2: (0.049, 2.41)}
```

To add another pump connected to **VDAC Channel 3** with a calibration curve slope of **0.056** and a y-intercept of **3.51** the previous code would become:

```python
self.pump_VDAC_channels = [2, 3]
self.pump_calibration = {2: (0.049, 2.41), 3: (0.056, 3.51)}
```

# Code Summary
The code for this application was designed to be reusable. The `Controller`, `Plot`, and `DataHandler` classes are all standalone and can be used separately. The `App` class contains most the application-specific code. The following code represents the core components of the `App` class that could be used to build a new application. 

* Application initialization code can be entered into the `__init__()` method.
* Application runtime code can be entered into the `main_update()` method.
* Application exit code can be entered into the `on_closing()` method.

The `main_thread()` method should not be changed as it regulates the app to run `main_update()` at the interval specified by the `refresh_time` variable with an accuracy of Â± 3ms.

More information on creating a `.bat` file to run the main Python file of your code can be found [Here](https://github.com/EthanThePorter/MCC-DAQ/blob/master/README.txt).
